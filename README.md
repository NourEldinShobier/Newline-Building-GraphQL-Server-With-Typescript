# Newline - Building GraphQL Server WithTypescript üë®‚Äçüíª

This course contains three core modules (i.e. chapters) that introduce and explain specific topics.

### MODULE 1 - GETTING STARTED WITH OUR NODE SERVER

- Introduction to Node and how Node is different to other web server technologies.
- Run a simple JavaScript file with Node.
- Create a server with the help of the popular Express package.
- Use [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) as a development tool to help with automatic reloading of our code.
- Introduction to TypeScript and the benefits of using it.
- Adding TypeScript to the server project and see how to compile a TypeScript project to valid JavaScript.
- Install and use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) as a development code linting tool.
- Finally, use mock data to create a GET and POST route within the server to mimic how RESTful APIs are to usually behave.

### MODULE 2 - COMPARING REST & GRAPHQL APIS

- Explanation of what GraphQL is.
- Comparison between [Github's REST](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and [Github's GraphQL](https://developer.github.com/v4/) APIs.
